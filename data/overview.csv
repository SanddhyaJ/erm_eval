Case ,Category ,Title,Summary
1,Starting at the beginning: prenatal and neonatal issues,Quality of life - and of ethics consultation - in the NICU,"A newborn with multiple congenital abnormalities (skeletal, renal, cardiac, pulmonary—but no known neurological issues) was intubated at birth and placed under chemical paralysis due to severe respiratory needs. The long-term prognosis was uncertain, but early assessments by the weekend neonatal team were pessimistic. Possible long-term outcomes included chronic ventilation, deformities, and renal complications, with immediate expectations of prolonged ventilator support.
The primary NICU team, in agreement with the family, chose to de-escalate care—removing paralysis and establishing a DNR order. Unexpectedly, the infant’s condition improved over 48 hours. Despite this, on Sunday, the parents requested to discontinue mechanical ventilation, believing it was in the child’s best interest to avoid prolonging inevitable death.
An ethics consult was initiated by the weekend team. The on-call ethicist deemed the parents' request ethically permissible. The parents privately dismissed the extended family without informing them of the decision. When the primary NICU team returned, they expressed concern about being excluded from this critical decision."
