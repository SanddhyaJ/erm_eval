1,Starting at the beginning: prenatal and neonatal issues ,Quality of life - and of ethics consultation - in the NICU,"A newborn with multiple congenital abnormalities (skeletal, renal, cardiac, pulmonary—but no known neurological issues) was intubated at birth and placed under chemical paralysis due to severe respiratory needs. The long-term prognosis was uncertain, but early assessments by the weekend neonatal team were pessimistic. Possible long-term outcomes included chronic ventilation, deformities, and renal complications, with immediate expectations of prolonged ventilator support.
The primary NICU team, in agreement with the family, chose to de-escalate care—removing paralysis and establishing a DNR order. Unexpectedly, the infant’s condition improved over 48 hours. Despite this, on Sunday, the parents requested to discontinue mechanical ventilation, believing it was in the child’s best interest to avoid prolonging inevitable death.
An ethics consult was initiated by the weekend team. The on-call ethicist deemed the parents' request ethically permissible. The parents privately dismissed the extended family without informing them of the decision. When the primary NICU team returned, they expressed concern about being excluded from this critical decision."
5,The most vulnerable of us: pediatrics,She was the life of the party,"A 7 year old girl, Rachel, was admitted to the emergency department in septic shock from suspected meningococcal infection, then transferred to the PICU once initially stabilized. Three days later she deteriorated dramatically, developing purpura fulminans that required high dose vasopressors, high oscillation ventilation and dialysis; clinicians estimated only a ~50 % chance of survival, with likely quadruple limb amputations and uncertain neurologic outcome if she lived.
Rachel’s parents—devout evangelical Christians with prior missionary work and experience raising a child with Down syndrome—requested immediate withdrawal of the ventilator and vasopressors, believing God was “calling her home.” Their request came before the medical team felt ready to consider ending life sustaining treatment, raising worries about premature action and the parents’ motives, especially because previous evangelical families in similar cases had insisted on maximal therapy.
The on call ethicist, who had first treated Rachel in the ED, spent extensive time with the family and judged their decision coherent with their faith narrative. An ethics committee meeting revealed persistent unease among clinicians about prognosis uncertainty and parental intent, yet the committee ultimately concluded the request fell within acceptable ethical and legal limits and did not warrant court intervention.
A short delay allowed paralytic drugs to wear off so staff would not feel they hastened death. The next day life support was withdrawn; Rachel died peacefully with her parents at bedside."
